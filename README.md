# Behind the Human Facade (WIP: 85%)

A group dev project for CGAE203: 2D-Game Development finals by Star Guardians. ꒰ᐢ. .ᐢ꒱₊˚⊹

## Description

Behind the Human Facade is a stealth game inspired by Philippine folklore, following Corazon, a manananggal, who leads two lives. By day, she blends into the bustling city; by night, she hunts in the shadows, using her wits and stealth to survive. </br> Torn between her human emotions and monstrous instincts, Corazon’s journey challenges players to balance secrecy and survival while unraveling the legacy of the manananggal myth. ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧
