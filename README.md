# Corazon: Between Day and Dusk (WIP: 90% and Polishing)

A group dev project for CGAE203: 2D-Game Development finals by team Star Guardians. ꒰ᐢ. .ᐢ꒱₊˚⊹

## Description
Corazon: Between Day and Dusk is a 2D-platformer stealth game inspired by Philippine folklore, following Corazon, a manananggal, who leads two lives. By day, she blends into the bustling city; by night, she hunts in the shadows, using her wits and stealth to survive. Torn between her human emotions and monstrous instincts, Corazon’s journey challenges players to balance secrecy and survival while unraveling the legacy of the manananggal myth. ✩₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧
